Experiment: trying to implement a generic fast DCT II/III based on "Fast and
numerically stable algorithms for discrete cosine transforms" from Gerlind
Plonkaa & Manfred Tasche (DOI: 10.1016/j.laa.2004.07.015).

Current status: working with `python dct.py 1` and `python dct.py 2`. Starting
`python dct.py 3`, permutations are wrong.

TODO: make it work for n â‰¥ 3
TODO: implement DCT-III (currently only attempting DCT-II)
TODO: implement the non recursive form
TODO: generate C code for a given size
